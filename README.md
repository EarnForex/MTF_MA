# Multi-Timeframe Moving Average (MTF MA)

**Multi-Timeframe Moving Average** or **MTF MA** is a moving average indicator that displays an MA calculated from the higher timeframe on the current chart of lower timeframe.

![MTF MA - example on EUR/USD @ M15 with H1, H4, and Daily MA's](https://github.com/EarnForex/MTF_MA)

The indicator can be used in Forex trading to monitor higher timeframes without switching up from the lower one.

If installing on MT4, copy the .mq4 file to */MQL4/Indicators/* subfolder of your platform's Data Folder.

If installing on MT5, copy the .mq5 file to */MQL5/Indicators/* subfolder of your platform's Data Folder.
